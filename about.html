      <h2 class="h2">About Skin Products</h2>
      <div class="about-description">
       
    
        <h3 class="css">1-Cleaners</h3>
        <div class=" custom-text"> Cleansing improves skin health and prevents breakouts by keeping your face clear of dirt, makeup and other impurities.  
          With many different cleansers on the market, choosing the right one will depend on your specific skin type and skin concerns.
          It is important to choose the correct cleanser to receive the most benefits and to minimize any potential side effects, such as overly dry skin. </div>
      </div>
  
      <div class="about-description">
        <h3 class="css">2-EyeCream</h3>
        <div class="custom-text"> Eye creams hydrate the undereye area and may even help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. 
          However, eye creams usually do not treat dark circles or reduce undereye puffiness. 
          You do not need to use an eye cream if you are younger, but if you are older and concerned about fine lines and wrinkles, it could be a good addition to your skincare routine. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="about-description">
        <h3 class="css">3-Face Oil</h3>

        <div class="custom-text"> Indulge your skin in the luxurious care of our Radiant Glow Face Oil. Specially crafted to nourish and revitalize, this lightweight and non-greasy formula are designed to provide a radiant and youthful complexion.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="about-description">
        <h3 class="css">4-SunScreen</h3>
        <div class="custom-text">
       
         SSunscreens are topical agents that can be applied to the skin to protect against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. 

         Exposure to UV radiation (UVR) contributes to skin ageing and is the main cause of skin cancer (eg, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma). Sun protection methods, including sunscreen and sun protective clothing, are important in reducing these damaging effects.
         
         The term ‘sunblock’, previously synonymous for sunscreen, is now considered misleading given that no sunscreen ‘blocks’ 100% of UVR. </div>
      
    </div>
    <div class="about-description">
      <h3 class="css">5-Toner</h3>
      <div class="custom-text">
     
        To put it simply, toner looks like water and acts like water. But I swear it's not water. It's packed with so much more than hydrogen and oxygen. Depending on the toner, it also can contain acids, glycerin, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatories.

If you want to talk science, a toner is a fast-penetrating liquid that delivers skin a quick hit of hydration and helps remove some dead cells off the surface of the skin. The result: plump, glowy skin, Lee says. On a makeup-related note, toner is like a primer for the rest of your skin-care routine like serums and moisturizer, New York-based dermatologist Arielle Kauvar tells Allure.</div>

    <div class="about-description">
      <h3 class="ccs">1.Necklaces</h3>
      <div class=" custom-text"> Necklaces are a fashion accessory that is worn around the neck. They were one of the first types of adornments worn by humans. They can be used as symbols of status and wealth or for religious, funerary, ceremonial purposes. The main element of the necklace is the cord, the chain, or band that wraps or dangles loosely around the neck. This can be made from metals like gold, silver, copper, and platinum or plastic, cloth, and other materials.</div>
      
      <h3 class="ccs">2.Bracelet</h3>
      <div class=" custom-text"> A bracelet is a piece of jewelry that is worn around the wrist. They are mostly ornamental but can serve different uses as well. Identity or medical information is often marked on bracelets including allergy tags or patient identification. Bracelets can also cater to religious and culture proposes or even to certain phenomena like breast cancer awareness. They can be made from different materials including cloth, plastic, bead, metal, leather, or any other materials</div>
     
      <h3 class="ccs">3.Nose Ring</h3>
      <div class=" custom-text"> Nose piercings have a really long history. In 1500 BCE, Lakshmi wore nose rings according to the Hindu book called Vedas. The modern practice of nose rings in India has been estimated to come from the Middle Eastern nomadic tribes that traveled the trade routes in the 16th century. Customs in Indian Hindu culture include that women of childbearing age wear a nose stud in their left nostril.

        Nose rings and pins can be made from substances like metal, plastic, and even glass. They come in unique designs and colors. Some are even studded with precious stones like diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, etc.</div>
     
      <h3 class="ccs">4.Rings</h3>
      <div class=" custom-text"> Rings are mainly worn as ornaments or as displays of wealth. They also play symbolic roles in relation to memberships to organizations, marriage, authority, ancestry, achievements, and other such phenomena. Rings can also be turned into an insignia that is compatible with wax seals or even have a small compartment to conceal things. In fiction, fable, and myths, rings are often endowed with supernatural, magical, or spiritual significance.</div>
